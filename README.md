## 🚀 About me

Engineer specialized in **quantitative trading**, **deep learning**, and **time-series modeling**.  
I build algorithmic trading pipelines with professional-grade standards:

- Triple-Barrier Labeling  
- Meta-Labeling + Sample Weights  
- Purged K-Fold + Embargo  
- Large-scale feature engineering (600+ features)  
- Synthetic data generation (IAAFT, ARMA-GARCH, CorGANs)  
- Ensemble/meta-models, MDA, SHAP explainability  
- Robust backtesting and strict out-of-sample validation

I’m deeply interested in:

- Deep Reinforcement Learning for markets  
- Liquid Neural Networks for small caps  
- LSTM embeddings + Attention for financial signals  
- NeuroAI and Brain-Computer Interfaces  
- Multi-agent simulation and complex adaptive systems  
- Cognitive digital twins

My 3-year goal: Become an **Applied Research Scientist** focused on NeuroAI/ML — with possible PhD track.
